Unemployment at a record high
People coming, people going, people born to die
Don't ask me, because I don't know why
But it's like that, and that's the way it is

People in the world tryin to make ends meet
You try to ride car, train, bus, or feet
I said you got to work hard, you want to compete
It's like that, and that's the way it is
Huh!

Money is the key to end all your woes
Your ups, your downs, your highs and your lows
Won't you tell me the last time that love bought you clothes?
It's like that, and that's the way it is

Bills rise higher every day
We receive much lower pay
I'd rather stay young, go out and play
It's like that, and that's the way it is
Huh!

Wars going on across the sea
Street soldiers killing the elderly
Whatever happened to unity?
It's like that, and that's the way it is

Disillusion is the word
That's used by me when I'm not heard
I just go through life with my glasses blurred
It's like that, and that's the way it is
Huh!

You can see a lot in this lifespan
Like a bum eating out of a garbage can
You noticed one time he was your man
It's like that (what?) and that's the way it is

You should have gone to school, you could've learned a trade
But you laid in the bed where the bums have laid
Now all the time you're crying that you're underpaid
It's like that (what?) and that's the way it is
Huh!

One thing I know is that life is short
So listen up homeboy, give this a thought
The next time someone's teaching why don't you get taught?
It's like that (what?) and that's the way it is

If you really think about it times aren't that bad
The one that flexes with successes will make you glad
Stop playing start praying, you won't be sad
It's like that (what?) and that's the way it is
Huh!

When you feel you fail sometimes it hurts
For a meaning in life is why you search
Take the bus or the train, drive to school or the church
It's like that, and that's the way it is

Here's another point in life you should not miss
Do not be a fool who's prejudiced
Because we're all written down on the same list
It's like that (what?) and that's the way it is
Huh!

You know it's like that, and that's the way it is
Because it's like that, and that's the way it is
(Repeat these lines til fade)
Know why I put myself out there for all to see?
'Cos noone cares about my brothers more than me
Course we're disadvantaged
But we got to take control by force 'cos this is carnage
I don't care if I killed a game and they don't want to crown me
The only reason people hear what I'm saying
Is that I feel the same when there's noone around me

All I need is fifty man, just fifty man
I ain't even planning nothing shifty, fam
You say you can't stand the state of the hood
So I dare you to commit to that statement for good
I'm saying fifty man, just fifty man
Just a brother utilising every gift he can
To make sure my little brothers and sisters in the ghetto
Don’t fall victim to the system and the metal
Understand that it’s you that I’m speaking to
Do you not realise what we can do?
Get a foot in the door and start sneaking through
I’m looking for more than hearts beating too
This ain’t rhetoric, I’m not a demagogue
If I was American, I’d rhyme that with a hella fog
‘Cos that’s what we’re trapped in
Gassed up with this trap ting
And then perpetuating all of that stuff with this rap ting
There’s forces that play that want to cause disarray
I’m like how can you lot not see it?
If you ever see me looking pissed and pensive
That’s ‘cos it’s so obvious it’s offensive
I told my guy keep your eyes on tomorrow
It’s hard but it’s only greasy for you today
He said easy for you to say
I ain’t sure to succeed
When you live in a drought, you can’t water the seed
I got a daughter to feed, I barely taught her to read
It’s hell, G, this fucking estate’s tense
So tell me something that makes sense
I told them watch me closely as I lift each hand
I need fifty man

Let’s run with this race and take over, give this place a make over
Muslim, Rasta, if the Witness ain’t of Jehovah
I don’t care, we’re going to finally break through
If you don’t let society shape you
It ain’t true that the business makes the stakeholder
No, Cuz, that’s a big mistake that they told us
We got so much in common but we focus on our differences
And we expect the effect not to be bogus on our infant kids
What do you think they think of this? Make inferences
Emotions spinning out of a ???
I ain’t inspirational, I just wake yous up
We’re the only hope for kids that harbour this stress because of fatherlessness
Am I the only one that cares about half of this mess?
People out there want to tame and control us
The rest of them think we’re insane and we’re soulless
The pain of the boulders and flame in our shoulders
Is exactly why I’m here blaming the olders
‘Cos this is real life and they should have told us
But they didn’t so now we’re finding out the hard way
Learning it’s impossible to grind without the heartache
But you’re not a soldier if you whine about the past dates
Look what we got through, what can we not do?
I want to see the gang mandem organise the border lines
And make sure the guys from the other side can’t come and ride on our side on a homicidal car ride
Imagining myself getting killed off by a pagan and I feels annihilation
From the hills that I’m adjacent to towards the fire station
I’d be dead in the ground and still feel the violation
I don’t want none of my brothers to die anymore
Who wants any other mothers to cry anymore?
So I’m talking to the rappers, talking to the trappers
Talking to the kids about to walk into the madness
Somewhere along the lines, somebody tricked you
Into sticking to the script big companies stick to
So if you ain’t with me, it’s a solo fight
‘cos these kids ain’t getting the meaning of YOLO right
I need fifty

Feeling used
But I'm
Still missing you
And I can't
See the end of this
Just wanna feel your kiss
Against my lips
And now all this time
Is passing by
But I still can't seem to tell you why
It hurts me every time I see you
Realize how much I need you

I hate you I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her

I miss you when I can't sleep
Or right after coffee
Or right when I can't eat
I miss you in my front seat
Still got sand in my sweaters
From nights we don't remember
Do you miss me like I miss you?
Fucked around and got attached to you
Friends can break your heart too, and
I'm always tired but never of you
If I pulled a you on you, you wouldn't like that shit
I put this reel out, but you wouldn't bite that shit
I type a text but then I nevermind that shit
I got these feelings but you never mind that shit
Oh oh, keep it on the low
You're still in love with me but your friends don't know
If u wanted me you would just say so
And if I were you, I would never let me go
I don't mean no harm
I just miss you on my arm
Wedding bells were just alarms
Caution tape around my heart
You ever wonder what we could have been?
You said you wouldn't and you fucking did
Lie to me, lie with me, get your fucking fix
Now all my drinks and all my feelings are all fucking mixed
Always missing people that I shouldn't be missing
Sometimes you gotta burn some bridges just to create some distance
I know that I control my thoughts and I should stop reminiscing
But I learned from my dad that it's good to have feelings
When love and trust are gone
I guess this is moving on
Everyone I do right does me wrong
So every lonely night, I sing this song

All alone I watch you watch her
Like she's the only girl you've ever seen
You don't care you never did
You don't give a damn about me
Yeah all alone I watch you watch her
She's the only thing you've ever seen
How is it you never notice
That you are slowly killing me

This what they all been waiting for
I guess so
They been waiting for this shit for a long time didn’t they
I'ma give it everything I got
Ayo Dougie park that X6 around the corner

Oh, it's just me, myself and I
Solo ride until I die
Cause I, got me for life
(Got me for life, yeah)
Oh I don't need a hand to hold
Even when the night is cold
I got that fire in my soul

And as far as I can see, I just need privacy
Plus a whole lot of tree, fuck all this modesty
I just need space to do me
Give the world what they're tryna see
A Stella Maxwell right beside of me
A Ferrari, I'm buyin' three
A closet of Saint Laurent, get what I want when I want
Cause this hunger is driving me, yeah
I just need to be alone, I just need to be at home
Understand what I'm speaking on
If time is money I need a loan
But regardless I'll always keep keepin' on
Fuck fake friends
We don't take L's, we just make M's
While y'all follow, we just make trends
I'm right back to work when that break ends

Oh, it's just me, myself and I
Solo ride until I die
Cause I, got me for life
(Got me for life, yeah)
Oh I don't need a hand to hold
Even when the night is cold
I got that fire in my soul

I don't need anything to get me through the night
Except the beat that's in my heart
And it's keeping me alive
(Keeps me alive)
I don't need anything to make me satisfied (you know)
Cause the music fills me good and it gets me every time

Yeah, and I don't like talking to strangers
So get the fuck off me I'm anxious
I'm tryna be cool but I may just go ape shit
Say "fuck y'all" to all of y'all faces
It changes though now that I'm famous
Everyone knows how this lifestyle is dangerous
But I love it the rush is amazing
Celebrate nightly and everyone rages
I found how to cope with my anger
I'm swimming in money
Swimming in liquor, my liver is muddy
But it's all good I'm still sippin' this bubbly
This shit is lovely, this shit ain't random, I didn't get lucky
Made it right here cause I'm sick with it cuddy
They all take the money for granted
But don't want to work for it tell me now, isn't it funny? nah

Oh, it's just me, myself and I
Solo ride until I die
Cause I, got me for life
(Got me for life, yeah)
Oh I don't need a hand to hold
Even when the night is cold
I got that fire in my soul

I don't need anything to get me through the night
Except the beat that's in my heart
Yeah, that's keeping me alive
(Keeps me alive)
I don't need anything to make me satisfied (you know)
Cause the music fills me good and it gets me every time

Cause the music fills me good and it gets me every time

Yeah, lonely nights I laid awake
Pray to lord, my soul to take
My heart's become too cold to break
Know I'm great but I'm broke as hell
Having dreams that I'm folding cake
All my life I've been told to wait
But I'ma get it now, yeah it's no debate
Yeah

Oh, it's just me, myself and I

(Got me for life, yeah)
Oh I don't need a hand to hold
Even when the night is cold
I got that fire in my soul

I don't need anything to get me through the night
Except the beat that's in my heart
And it's keeping me alive
(Keeps me alive)
I don't need anything to make me satisfied (you know)
Cause the music fills me good and it gets me every time

Dry! ...Me a desert him
Nuh time to have you lurking
Him ah go act like he nuh like it
You know I dealt with you the nicest
Nuh body touch me you nuh righteous
Nuh badda, text me in a crisis
I believed all of your dreams, adoration
You took my heart and my keys and my patience
You took my heart on my sleeve for decoration
You mistaken my love I brought for you for foundation
All that I wanted from you was to give me
Something that I never had
Something that you've never seen
Something that you've never been!
Mmmmm!
But I wake up and act like nothing's wrong
Just get ready fi...


Beg you something please
Baby don't you leave
Don’t leave me stuck here in the streets, uh huh
If I get another chance to
I will never, no never neglect you
I mean who am I to hold your past against you?
I just hope that it gets to you
I hope that you see this through
I hope that you see this true
What can I say?
Please recognize I'm tryin', babe!!!

Meh nuh cyar if him
Hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt, hurting

Yeah, okay
You need to get done, done, done, done at work, come over
We just need to slow the motion
Don't give that away to no one
Long distance, I need you
When I see potential I just gotta see it through
If you had a twin, I would still choose you
I don't wanna rush into it, if it's too soon
But I know you need to get done, done, done, done
If you come over
Sorry if I'm way less friendly
I got niggas tryna end me, oh
I spilled all my emotions tonight, I’m sorry
Rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
How many more shots until you're rollin'?
We just need a face to face
You could pick the time and the place
You spent some time away
Now you need to forward and give me all the...

Mmmmm, mmmmm

Spent it all on me (I spent it all on me)
Diamonds all appraised (diamonds all appraised)
And I'm bossing up (and I'm bossing up)

Ah, my dollars ain't foldin', you was never the homie

Seen black turn 'em Burgundy

Cornrow Kenny, he was born with a vision
All morning with the mixed dashboards triple digits
Parallel park like an alien, can't visit
Slideshow for the night show, ten bitches
Find hoes with a blindfold, King Kendrick
(Hello Billy)
So many plays on me I finesse
Palisade views with some sex
I lost a lot of love for missionary
This the first time I confess
Me and Top is like a Kobe and Phil
A father figure fuck with him, you get killed
Fuck with me and he will kill you himself
TDE the mafia of the west
Move in silence, yeah, we juggin’ like that
Act of violence, yeah, we juggin’ like that
I did a lot of dumb shit in my past
Lord forgive me, hoping I don't relapse
Dave just bought a new nine eleven
Almost thought I’d seen another plane crash
Q just bought a brand new McLaren
Rock-a-lack about to buy the projects
Moosa got his son dripping in gold
Ali 'bout to let his hair down on hoes
Me, I'm about to let my hair down on hoes
Top billing that’s a million a show
Might blow the whole no whammy on Soul
Might tell Obama be more like Punch
Sounwave caught a Grammy last year
Mack wop, bet he do what he want
Fuck you niggas, level two I'm not done
2Teez told me that I am the one
I can put a rapper on life support
Guarantee that's something none of you want
Ten homies down and they all serving life
Water's like twenty-five hundred a month
What if I empty my bank out and stunt?
What if I certified all of these ones?
Bitch I get buck, I'm as real as they come
Shit is amazing, I'm feeding my cravings
You know that you want me come here now lil' baby

Serving it like I belong in the basement
Or live at the Days Inn
Yan Yan my relative, black cherry soda
Pistol and poverty, come get to know us

I'm tryna keep my faith
We on an ultralight beam
We on an ultralight beam
This is a God dream
This is a God dream
This is everything
This is everything
Deliver us serenity
Deliver us peace
Deliver us loving
We know we need it
You know we need it
You know we need it
That's why we need you now, oh, I
Pray for Paris
Pray for the parents
This is a God dream
This is a God dream
This is a God dream
We on an ultralight beam
We on an ultralight beam
This is a God dream
This is a God dream
This is everything
Everything (Thing, thing, thing)

I'm tryna keep my faith
But I'm looking for more
Somewhere I can feel safe
And end my holy war
I'm tryna keep my faith

So why send oppression not blessings?
Why, oh why'd you do me wrong? (More)
You persecute the weak
Because it makes you feel so strong
(To save) Don't have much strength to fight
So I look to the light
(War) To make these wrongs turn right
Head up high, I look to the light
Hey, cause I know that you'll make everything alright
And I know that you'll take good care of your child
Oh, no longer am afraid of the night
Cause I, I look to the light

When they come for you, I will shield your name
I will field their questions, I will feel your pain
They don't know, they don't
They don't know, they don't know
Foot on the Devil's neck 'til it drifted Pangaea
I'm moving all my family from Chatham to Zambia
Treat the demons just like Pam
I mean I fuck with your friends, but damn, Gina
I been this way since Arthur was anteater
Now they wanna hit me with the woo wap the bam
Tryna snap photos of familia
My daughter look just like Sia, you can't see her
You can feel the lyrics, the spirit coming in braille
Tubman of the underground, come and follow the trail
I made Sunday Candy, I'm never going to hell
I met Kanye West, I'm never going to fail
He said let's do a good ass job with Chance three
I hear you gotta sell it to snatch the Grammy
Let's make it so free and the bars so hard
That there ain't one gosh darn part you can't tweet
This is my part, nobody else speak
This is my part, nobody else speak
This little light of mine
Glory be to God, yeah
I'mma make sure that they go where they can't go
If they don't wanna ride I'mma still give them raincoats
Know what God said when he made the first rainbow
Just throw this at the end if I'm too late for the intro
Ugh, I'm just having fun with it
You know that a nigga was lost
I laugh in my head
Cause I bet that my ex looking back like a pillar of salt
Ugh, cause they'll flip the script on your ass like Wesley and Spike
You cannot mess with the light
Look at lil Chano from 79th

We on an ultralight beam
We on an ultralight beam
This is a God dream
This is a God dream
This is everything
Everything

(Yes, God
Hallelujah)
I'm tryna keep my faith
(Yes, Jesus)
But I'm looking for more
Somewhere I can feel safe
And end my holy war

Father, this prayer is for everyone that feels they're not good enough. This prayer's for everybody that feels like they're too messed up. For everyone that feels they've said "I'm sorry" too many times. You can never go too far when you can't come back home again. That's why I need...
Faith, more, safe, war

Look, if you had one shot or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment
Would you capture it or just let it slip?
Yo

His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already: Mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's choking, how? Everybody's joking now!
The clock's run out, time's up, over - blaow
Snap back to reality, oh, there goes gravity
Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't
Give up that easy nope, he won't have it, he knows
His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter, he's dope
He knows that, but he's broke, he's so stagnant, he knows
When he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again, yo! This whole rhapsody
He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him

The soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking, make me king
As we move toward a New World Order
A normal life is boring; but superstardom's
Close to post-mortem, it only grows harder
Homie grows hotter, he blows it's all over
These hoes is all on him, coast to coast shows
He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads
God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera
Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner
But the beat goes on: da-da-dum da-dum dah-dah

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo

No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playing in the beginning, the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhyming and stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebody's paying the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-
Five and I can't provide the right type of
Life for my family, cause man, these God damn
Food stamps don't buy diapers, and there's no movie
There's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's getting even harder
Tryna feed and water my seed plus, teeter-totter
Caught up between being a father and a prima donna
Baby momma drama, screaming on her too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony
Has gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail, I've got
To formulate a plot, or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option - failure's not
Mom, I love you but this trailer's got to go
I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go it's my shot, feet: fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got

You can do anything you set your mind to, man
